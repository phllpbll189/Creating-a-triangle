# Goal

Do as the title says: Learn opengl

This repository is following and tweaking a guide from [Learn openGl](https://learnopengl.com/Introduction)

# how to build
This project uses cmake to build. This makes it convenient on both linux and windows (i don't have a mac and I don't have intentions on getting one)
To build this project 

1. clone the project
2. make sure you have cmake and a compiler already installed
3. run cmake --build build in the base of the project's directory

this will make a build folder to keep the project organized.

within the build folder there will be a debug folder that contains the executable for your platform.

# What to expect

Depending on the branch that you build you will get different outcomes.

each branch has me learning different things and using what I learned in different ways.

i will merge into main when I feel I've made suitable progress in the guide.

For instance. The main branch current has a rectangle that uses the sin function on the green value.

Thus a flashing green rectangle.


## how to follow progress?

Branches will be made from 'checkpoints'. 

each section in the guide has a few challenges.
Since the challenges don't build into the next section of the guide, I will make a new branch for the challenge.

This will start at the texture section of the guide as I found everything before that to be relatively easy with my current experience.
